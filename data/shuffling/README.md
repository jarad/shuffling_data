# How to shuffle and record
- Start with cards order from 1 to 52 with 1 on the bottom, 52 on the top.
- Back side faces the participants and the number side faces the floor/desk.
- Participants are going to cut the card in two parts and then riffle shuffle them once. (Make sure shuffle riffle only with no other riffling).
- After one time shuffling, flip the cards to make the number side faces to you.
- Record cards from top to bottom (with number side faces to you).
- Keep the order for the next shuffle: After recording one card, flip it back to put on desk for next shuffling. The back side should face you after recording.
- Repeat multiple times.
